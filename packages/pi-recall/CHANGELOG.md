# Changelog

## 1.0.0
### Major Changes

- Adopt a unified 1.0.0 across every published package.
  
  The version numbers no longer track their upstream forks individually; from this release each package
  is versioned on its own merit against the Signalridge line, and 1.0.0 is the shared starting point.
  Packages whose behavior changed in this release document that change in their own changeset entries;
  the remainder are re-released unchanged so the whole set shares one baseline.

### Patch Changes

- Strip Unicode bidirectional overrides — and DCS/PM/APC payloads in the footer and recall picker — from untrusted text before display, so a crafted branch name, worktree path, model id, or recalled message can no longer visually reverse what the user reads and acts on.
- Wire the hardened terminal sanitizers to the fields that actually carry hostile text, bound the escape-sequence skippers, and give worktree Add base-commit provenance.
  
  - `pi-statusline`: the `branch`, `provider`, and `tools` segments now pass through `sanitizeTerminalText`. The branch is sanitized before the GitHub PR context is composed in, so a hostile ref name can no longer emit raw OSC/CSI/bidi into the footer while the PR hyperlink keeps working.
  - `pi-statusline` / `pi-recall`: an escape-sequence introducer with no terminator now drops only itself instead of consuming the rest of the string, so a single `0x90` in a branch name or saved message no longer blanks a footer row, a preview, or the fuzzy-search text. SOS is handled alongside DCS/PM/APC.
  - `pi-recall`: previews are sanitized before truncation, so the preview budget is spent on visible characters instead of invisible escape bytes.
  - `pi-worktree`: line separators are replaced with a space instead of being dropped, so multi-line Git output no longer welds two records together inside a destructive confirmation body.
  - `pi-worktree`: Add resolves the base commit for both the create and the attach case (the attach case previously captured none, letting Git re-resolve the branch at exec time), shows the full base OID in the confirmation, and re-reads `git worktree list`, the local branch ref, and the base OID under the worktree mutation lock immediately before `git worktree add`. A base that moved, or a branch or path claimed while the dialog was open, refuses the add with a message naming both OIDs instead of silently creating a worktree from an unapproved base.

## Unreleased

- Refresh package metadata and Pi namespace compatibility.
