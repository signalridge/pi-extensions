# @signalridge/pi-btw

## 1.0.0
### Major Changes

- Adopt a unified 1.0.0 across every published package.
  
  The version numbers no longer track their upstream forks individually; from this release each package
  is versioned on its own merit against the Signalridge line, and 1.0.0 is the shared starting point.
  Packages whose behavior changed in this release document that change in their own changeset entries;
  the remainder are re-released unchanged so the whole set shares one baseline.

### Minor Changes

- Add session- and branch-scoped, in-memory resumable side threads with a bounded searchable picker, stable IDs, activity ordering, and thread-local thinking levels while keeping direct questions fresh and avoiding disk persistence.

## 0.49.7

### Patch Changes

- 3f33860: Run side threads in a dedicated full-screen TUI so mouse-drag copying stays stable while the main agent continues producing output in the background.
- 2a2c9c1: Queue Pi-style steering questions while a side-thread answer is running, process them one at a time without touching the main conversation, and report malformed side-model responses without hanging the side UI.

## 0.49.6

### Patch Changes

- a4b44ee: Route side-question completions through Pi's effective runtime provider so custom provider APIs work.
