## 1.2.1
### Patch Changes

- b6cf242: Peer dependency ranges now name the versions actually validated against, so an untested host combination fails at install time instead of silently at runtime: `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `pi-ai`, `pi-tui`, and `pi-agent-core` move from `"*"` to `^0.84.0`, and `typebox` from `"*"` to `^1.3.11`.
  
  Shared dependencies now carry ONE declared range across every package that uses them, and `bun run check:shared-deps` keeps it that way.
  
  `@narumitw/pi-tui-kit` was declared at three disjoint floors — `^0.54.0`, `^0.51.0`, and `^0.49.1` across nine packages — and the lockfile duly resolved three copies (0.54.0, 0.51.0, 0.49.3) installed side by side. For a shared rendering surface drawing into one terminal inside one host process, that means a theme rendering one way in one extension and another way in the next, with nothing failing at install to say so. All nine now declare `^0.54.0` and the install resolves a single copy. `@sinclair/typebox` likewise converges on `^0.34.50`.
  
  The new check covers `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` and compares range strings rather than their semantics: two ranges that merely overlap are still a finding, because the goal is one intentional answer per dependency rather than an accidental intersection. `devDependencies` are deliberately out of scope — a build tool is not a shared surface, and `pi-subagents` intentionally carries its own toolchain. `docs/package-boundaries.md` documents the Kit as a shared surface for the first time.

## 1.0.0
### Major Changes

- Adopt a unified 1.0.0 across every published package.
  
  The version numbers no longer track their upstream forks individually; from this release each package
  is versioned on its own merit against the Signalridge line, and 1.0.0 is the shared starting point.
  Packages whose behavior changed in this release document that change in their own changeset entries;
  the remainder are re-released unchanged so the whole set shares one baseline.

### Patch Changes

- Neutralize terminal control sequences and bidirectional overrides in the last three surfaces that rendered untrusted text raw: the recap the model writes from tool output, the workspace facts on the startup card, and the directory name written into the terminal title as an OSC escape sequence. The recap also sanitizes transcript text before it truncates it, so a cut can never hand the model half of an escape sequence.
- Publish the screenshots and example template the README points at, so the npm page no longer renders broken images or a dead file reference.
- Read `PI_TAB_STATUS_STYLE` when a title is formatted instead of freezing it at module load, so the style is a runtime input rather than an import-time side effect, and cover the full run lifecycle in both the legacy and ridgeline styles.

## Unreleased

- Add the optional text-only Signalridge Ridgeline tab-title style while preserving the legacy emoji format.
